Truthbrush is an API client for Truth Social. Truthbrush is built and maintained by the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu).
This is a fork and refined version made by @Kirisame-Official in order to cope with the flooding posts posted by Donald Trump. Feel free to enjoy! 

## Installation
